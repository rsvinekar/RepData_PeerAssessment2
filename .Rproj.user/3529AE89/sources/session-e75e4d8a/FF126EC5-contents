## Google Analytics Capstone Project

Along with the Coursera datascience course running parallel, this capstone project is the 8th part of the Google Analytics Certificate. It works with very similar data, and very similar analysis with an emphasis on R. Thus the capstone project was left to the last, after the Johns Hopkins data science courses. This allows a full background for using R markdown, GIT and ggplots wherein both courses teach nearly the same thing with completely different approaches.  


The actual project is documented in the [CaseStudy1](CaseStudy1.md) file

This is accompanied by the corresponding Rmarkdown [CaseStudy1.Rmd](CaseStudy1.Rmd) file for reference. The question and guide for the project is [given here](aacF81H_TsWnBfNR_x7FIg_36299b28fa0c4a5aba836111daad12f1_DAC8-Case-Study-1.pdf). A [presentation](Presentation.pptx) is also there.
